# ATM Kata

---
This is a simple kata for practicing TDD. It would be a good idea to create a new branch with your name.

## Specification
Build a virtual ATM machine:
- The machine should start off with 5 of each of the following denominations
  - R100
  - R50
  - R20
  - R10
- When the user requests to draw an amount, it should dispense the amount in the notes that it has available
- If it cannot dispense the exact amount, it should show an error

### Notes
Create a branch with your name and your own implementation.

Fix the todo's in `index.ts`.
